## Larabook Updated - Laravel 5.0

A light version of Facebook, called Larabook. Updated using new techniques and features of Laravel 5.0

### Fixes

I tried my best to rebuild it for Laravel 5.0 as the series was originally written for Laravel 4.2. Some ways have
become outdated, with much of the features coming straight out-the-box with Laravel 5.0.

If you see another way of doing things or if I have made a mistake completely, feel free to message me as I would love to
know where I've gone wrong, too.


## Original Series

You can find the original video series from Laracast at: https://laracasts.com/series/build-a-laravel-app-from-scratch

## Disclaimer

I am by no means a Laravel / PHP pro by any standard. Most of what I learnt has been from Jeffrey on Laracasts. You might
do things differently than I would and that's fine, I just wanted to see if I could make it all in Laravel 5.0
